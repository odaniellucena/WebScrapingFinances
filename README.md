# Web Scraping of Companies earnings data

If you invest your money on stocks markets, you already know how important it is to know the amounts of earnings historically paid by companies. This information is very valuable for calculating various KPIs that will help make decisions about what to do with that particular asset ðŸ¤‘ . Fortunately, many companies offer this information, but some only allow you to download the data if you pay for a plan they offer. If you don't want to pay, just copy and paste. The questions are:
1. Are you willing to copy and paste data from 600+ companies?
2. You know that this data changes every month, right?

How about automating this task? That's where web scraping comes in. I leave you to download some Python scripts that, using Beautiful Soup, Pandas and Matplotlib, extracts the earnings data from the Fundamentus, B3 and Dividend Investor websites. The code is all commented, standardized according to PEP-8.
